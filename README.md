This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python code that calculates the average of a list of numbers. The bug arises when dealing with empty lists or lists containing zero values. The original code lacks robust handling for these edge cases, potentially leading to errors like ZeroDivisionError or unexpected results. The solution shows how to address these scenarios to produce more reliable and accurate average calculations.
